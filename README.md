# PIXOGENE

PIXOGENE is a Python-based web application for image encryption using DNA encoding.

## Overview

PIXOGENE leverages DNA encoding techniques to encrypt images, providing a unique approach to securing visual data. It converts image pixels into DNA sequences and applies encryption algorithms to ensure confidentiality.

## Features

- **Image Encryption:** Encrypt images using DNA encoding.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt encrypted images back to their original format.
- **Web Interface:** User-friendly web interface for easy interaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixogene.git
   cd pixogene
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access PIXOGENE:**
   Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image:**
   Upload an image file (.jpg, .png, etc.) to encrypt.

2. **Encrypt Image:**
   Click on the "Encrypt" button to apply DNA encoding for encryption.

3. **Download Encrypted Image:**
   Once encrypted, download the encrypted image for secure storage or further processing.

4. **Decrypt Image:**
   If needed, upload the encrypted image and click "Decrypt" to retrieve the original image.
